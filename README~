ERD uses the libRNA.a from the Vienna RNA Package. Thus before compiling
ERD, you have to configure and install the Vienna RNA Package. You can
download it at: 

http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~ivo/RNA/

Then modidy the Makefile of INFO-RNA such that the library path is set 
correctly, e.g.:

VIENNA          = /home/Vienna_1.6



ERD can handle sequence constraints, which can be given in IUPAC
symbols using the -c option. 



ERD adapts to the new GCC compiler.
