# ERD - Evolutionary RNA Designer

## Overview
ERD (Evolutionary RNA Designer) is a tool for RNA inverse folding. It is designed to find RNA sequences that fold into a given secondary structure. This project is based on evolutionary algorithms to optimize RNA sequences.

## Features
- **Inverse RNA Folding**: Finds RNA sequences that match a given secondary structure.
- **Evolutionary Algorithms**: Utilizes evolutionary strategies to optimize RNA sequences.
- **Cross-Platform**: Written in C, making it compatible with various operating systems.

## Installation
To compile and run ERD, you need a C compiler (e.g., GCC). Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/ali1366/erd.git
    cd erd
    ```

2. Compile the code:
    ```sh
    gcc -o erd main.c -lm
    ```

3. Run the executable:
    ```sh
    ./erd
    ```

## Usage
ERD is a command-line tool. After compiling, you can run the executable and follow the on-screen instructions to input the desired RNA secondary structure.
ERD can handle sequence constraints, which can be given in IUPAC
symbols using the -c option. 



ERD adapts to the new GCC compiler.

## Requierment
ERD uses the libRNA.a from the Vienna RNA Package. Thus before compiling
ERD, you have to configure and install the Vienna RNA Package. You can
download it at: 

http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~ivo/RNA/

Then modidy the Makefile of INFO-RNA such that the library path is set 
correctly, e.g.:

VIENNA          = /home/Vienna_1.6
